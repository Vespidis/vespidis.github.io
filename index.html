  <h1>My IT Profile</h1>
  <p><ul>
<li> 1.	From a personal perspective I’ve always had an interest in IT, being part of a generation where interacting with technology was integral, it’s just a part of my everyday life, though on a personal level I spend most of my spare time playing video games. That’s how I relax and unwind, how I interact with friends and family. Professionally though, IT is something entirely different. I absolutely love problem solving, thinking outside the box, or remaking old processes into something new and more efficient. So professionally I’m attracted to the idea of programming, what that specifically means in 3 years’ time, I’m not sure.  Perhaps I’ll look at software development or security, but right now that means I’m passionate about learning new languages!</li>
