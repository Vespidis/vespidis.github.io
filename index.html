  <h1>My IT Profile</h1>
  <p><ul>
<li>From a personal perspective I’ve always had an interest in IT. being part of a generation where interacting with technology was integral, it’s just a part of my everyday life. On a personal level I spend most of my spare time playing video games. Professionally though, IT is something entirely different. I absolutely love problem solving, thinking outside the box, or remaking old processes into something new and more efficient. So professionally I’m attracted to the idea of programming, what that specifically means in 3 years’ time, I’m not sure.  Perhaps I’ll look at software development or security, but right now that means I’m passionate about learning new languages!</li>

<li>I chose to come to RMIT because they offered what I needed through OUA. A flexible course that I could do at a reasonable pace whilst working full time. It’s very hard to put the brakes on and go back to studying, but this means I get the best of both worlds through a little hard work.</li>

<li>I expect to learn more in depth about the many and varied paths that I can take in IT. In addition to this, I hope to learn more about hardware and how hardware and software interact. I expect to learn more about programming languages as well.</li>
