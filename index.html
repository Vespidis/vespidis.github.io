<h1>My IT Profile</h1>
<h4> What are your interests and plans for you future in IT, and why did you choose RMIT? </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>From a personal perspective I’ve always had an interest in IT. being part of a generation where interacting with technology was integral, it’s just a part of my everyday life. On a personal level I spend most of my spare time playing video games. Professionally though, IT is something entirely different. I absolutely love problem solving, thinking outside the box, or remaking old processes into something new and more efficient. So professionally I’m attracted to the idea of programming, what that specifically means in 3 years time, I’m not sure.  Perhaps I’ll look at software development or security, but right now that means I’m passionate about learning new languages!</li>
<li>I chose to come to RMIT because they offered what I needed through OUA. A flexible course that I could do at a reasonable pace whilst working full time. It’s very hard to put the brakes on and go back to studying, but this means I get the best of both worlds through a little hard work.</li>
<li>I expect to learn more in depth about the many and varied paths that I can take in IT. In addition to this, I hope to learn more about hardware and how hardware and software interact. I expect to learn more about programming languages as well.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Personality Test Results</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>16 Personalities Test</b> <br>

<li><b>Learning Styles Test</b><br>

<li><b>Creativity Quiz</b><br>
Rating 64 (Highly Creative) - <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">CREATIVITY SUMMARY</a></li>
</ul>

These tests all indicate that I have a tendency to be a creative and anayltical thinker, but that I sometimes miss the details for the bigger picture, so what I should be looking for when it comes to groups/teamwork are people who are detail orientedwho can look at the finer details and balance me out in that regard. I think these results point towards my goals aligning with my internal strengths, as I think being creative and having a bigger picture idea of problems are what make a good programmer but that I should be careful to not lose focus without getting anything done.In addition to this, I should always try to put together a visual que or have someone talk me through an idea if I don't understand it, as this is how I learn best.

<h1>My Project</h1>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The intention of the project (GlobeTouch) is to provider customers of the Cruising (and travel) industry, an interactive booking resource that provides a more dynamic experience.
This user interface will allow guests to have a more kinaesthetic experience when booking their holidays, by allowing them to “interact” with a world globe, which will then give them all the required information whilst booking their holiday.
</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Of the world’s leading cruise lines, including business’ such as Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, the vast majority of them offer an extremely basic an objectively boring booking experience, a simple search engine which provides a return list of available cruises which can often be hard to grasp for many potential customers (See example links for common cruise searches). In addition to this, varying studies have shown that in general, a more interactive online experience will increase user satisfaction. <br>

Whilst these list styles will appeal to some visual learners, what it fails to do is capture the “experience” factor and enhance the excitement of travelling to a destination that’s often half the world away. What I hope to do with TouchGlobe (my current name for the project) is provide a booking experience that appeals to not just visual learners, but also kinaesthetic and auditory learners too. Whilst maintaining an efficient and streamlined qualifying/booking experience to maximise revenue.
